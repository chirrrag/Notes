VARIABLES
> a = 1
    variable "a", refers to value 1
> print(a)
---
> b = 2
> print(b)
---
> c = 'hello there'
> print(c)
---
> d = 2
> print(d)

in variables, b and d both refers to value 2. Its possible in python for 2 or more vars to point to same value.

> print(e)
    ERROR
    Name 'e' is not defined 

> a = 1
> f = a
    f refers to value which a is refering to, f doesnt refers to a (f refers to whatever value a is refering to)
> a = 2

# SWAPPING 2 VARIABLES
> a = 1
> b = 2
> a,b = b,a




# if else


# functions
- collections of instructions, code that we have to repeat execution

> def function1():
>     print("ahhhh")
>     print("aahchu")
>     print("outside the function")

- call the function
> function1()


# LIST

> list1=[1,2,3,4]
> print(list1)

## for loops

## while loops

## dictionaries
